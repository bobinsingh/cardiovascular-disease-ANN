Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This model is designed to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on a variety of health-related features. The dataset includes key attributes such as:

1. Height (cm)
2. Weight (kg)
3. Systolic Blood Pressure (ap_hi)
4. Diastolic Blood Pressure (ap_lo)
5. Age in Years
6. Gender
7. Cholesterol Levels
8. Glucose Levels
9. Smoking Habits
10. Alcohol Consumption
11. Physical Activity


The model is built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and leverages these features to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (the target variable, cardio). The features were carefully processed, including the handling of outliers and transformations to ensure the best possible model performance. The goal is to assist in the early detection of cardiovascular conditions, enabling better prevention and management strategies.

This project is a step towards integrating machine learning into healthcare, providing a tool that can help in predicting and potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases through data-driven insights.
